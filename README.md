## Crystal Clear
This project includes a script for an Arduino Nano IOT 33 + a TouchDesigner file. The TouchDesigner file requires a video file that is too large to include here. (For my own reference, I'm storing it in Dropbox)

The Arduino communicates with TD over serial, sending commands that control the video playback
